Limitions between ReVanced Extended and this patches : 

❌ Features worse than ReVanced Extended

❌ No Import/export settings function

❌ No force VP9 codec function

❌ No custom branding icon & name & custom package name

❌ Ad-block might not work well

❌ No brightness & volume swipe gesture

✅ allow-nomicrog patch : Can run without Vanced microG (non-root variant) with no login function (Like old Vanced <16.xx.xx)

✅ video-download patch : Built-in video & audio downloader inside patch (NewPipe integration)

✅ Stability 

✅ Compatible with Unisoc processor devices

✅ Actually is a specific Vanced patch (not ReVanced anymore)

Branding icon & name will build as YouTube Vanced icon & name. If you build non-root variant, package name will change to : com.vanced.android.youtube.

There is no options to custom branding icon & name to prevent someone else build YouTube Vanced as ReVanced branding name & icon.
