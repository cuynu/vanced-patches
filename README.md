Limitions between ReVanced Extended and this patches : 

❌ Features worse more than [ReVanced Extended](https://t.me/revanced_extended)

❌ No Import/export settings function

❌ No "Force VP9 codec" function

❌ No custom branding icon & name & custom package name

❌ Ad-block might not work well

❌ No brightness & volume swipe gesture

✅ Stability 

✅ Compatible with device using Unisoc processors

✅ Actually is a specific Vanced patch (not ReVanced anymore)

Branding icon & name will build as YouTube Vanced icon & name. If you build non-root variant, package name will change to : com.vanced.android.youtube.

There is no options like custom branding icon & name to prevent someone else build YouTube Vanced as ReVanced branding name & icon.
